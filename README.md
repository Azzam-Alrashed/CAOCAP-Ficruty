## The Mission
**Push the boundaries. Improve the experience.**

We aren't here to advocate for a specific niche or a "new way" to program. We are here to relentlessly challenge how software is built. If a boundary exists that limits a developer's creativity, we push it. If an experience is broken, we fix it. 

Ficruty is the pursuit of the ultimate developer experience, by any means necessary.


## The Philosophy
Ficruty is a technical pursuit of the "forgotten future" presented by **Bret Victor** in ["The Future of Programming"](https://youtu.be/8pTEmbeENF4). 


## The Core Concept
An agentic & mobile first platform/ecosystem for collaborative code editing.


## Tech Stack
Ficruty is built with a focus on native performance and architectural predictability.

- **Language**: [Swift 5.10+](https://swift.org) — Leveraging modern concurrency and performance.
- **UI Framework**: [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) — Native, gesture-driven interface with high-fidelity spatial interactions.
- **State Management**: [The Composable Architecture (TCA)](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) — Ensuring predictable, testable, and serializable state for complex agent-human coordination.
- **Web Engine**: [WebKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit) — Native high-performance rendering for the HTML5+ ecosystem.
- **Spatial Engine**: [SwiftUI Canvas](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/canvas) — Optimized infinite grid rendering for high-density node environments.



## Current Status
Ficruty is currently in the **Foundation Phase**, focusing on the core spatial runtime and node infrastructure. 

While this iteration is new, the idea has been evolving since 2018 through the personal and professional experience of [Azzam Alrashed](https://github.com/Azzam-Alrashed). This project is the culmination of several [previous attempts and prototypes](https://github.com/orgs/CAOCAP/repositories).



## Getting Started
Ficruty is built in Swift and requires Xcode 15+.

1. **Clone** this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CAOCAP/Ficruty.git
   ```
2. **Open** the project:
   Open `caocap/caocap.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
3. **Run**:
   Select the `caocap` target and an appropriate simulator or device, then press `Cmd + R`.



## Contributing
Ficruty is in active, early-stage development. We are currently in a "War Room" phase where we prioritize architectural stability and long-term vision over rapid feature growth.

- **Discussion First**: For major changes, please open an issue or start a discussion to ensure alignment with the project's core philosophy.
- **Technical Standards**: We use SwiftUI for the frontend and The Composable Architecture (TCA) for state management. Contributions should adhere to these patterns.
- **Push the Boundaries**: We value contributions that challenge the status quo and improve the developer experience.

### 2026-04-20: The Foundation & The Vision

- **Established the Core Identity**:
    - **Mission Locked**: Committed to a relentless focus on **Developer Experience (DX)** and pushing technological boundaries.
    - **Platform Philosophy**: Agreed that while code remains text-based, the infrastructure around it must evolve.
